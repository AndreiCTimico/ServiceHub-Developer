### Process

As long as all requirements have been met, you'll be able to generate your API Key.

 3. Select the 'Developer' Heading.
 
 4. Click the Generate API Key button.
 
 5. Provide the API Key name, this is for your reference only. It allows for you to refer to an API Key (as you may have many) without showing you the actual API Key.
 
 6. Once submitted, you will be shown your API Key for you to store securely and use whilst calling ServiceHub API.
 
_**Please note that you will only be able to see this key once and would need to regenerate the key if lost, so make a note of your API Key at this stage (and store it somewhere secure).**_
